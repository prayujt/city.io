# city.io
An idle city-building strategy game written in Go and TypeScript using the Angular framework. <br />
<br />
Build your own City! Start as a tiny town and gradually grow to a thriving metropolis. Collect profits and invest in upgrades that grow your city. While you are away, the denizens of your city will generate profit for you. Fill your city with cool businesses, gyms, buildings, and whatever else your heart desires.

# Game Functions
- The game will take place on a grid-based board representing available land, which players can use to construct different kinds of buildings, such as housing and various kinds of businesses.
- Constructing buildings requires the player to spend DobraCoins, which are passively accrued over time based on a variety of factors, including population, residential and commercial buildings, etc. Buildings take time to construct.
- There is a population count that increases or decreases based on certain variables. A higher population count means more production. Building housing increases the maximum population count for your city.
- Buildings will have unique designs, so you can decorate your city in your own way.
- You can sabotage other players!
